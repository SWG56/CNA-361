# 🌐 CNA361 - Computer Networks & Administration

Welcome to my project repository for **CNA361**, a core module in my Diploma in Information Technology (Security) at **Belgium Campus iTversity**.

---

## 📘 Module Overview

**CNA361** explores the practical and theoretical aspects of computer networking and system administration. The focus is on designing, securing, and managing network infrastructures, with a strong integration of cloud-based services through **Microsoft Azure**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this module, I have:

- Mastered the OSI and TCP/IP networking models
- Designed and deployed networked systems using **Microsoft Azure**
- Configured and managed cloud-based virtual machines, subnets, and network interfaces
- Implemented DHCP, DNS, NAT, and VLANs both on-prem and in the cloud
- Secured virtual networks with Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and firewalls
- Monitored and troubleshooted performance using Azure dashboards and network tools

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- ☁️ **Microsoft Azure Portal**
- 📶 **Azure Virtual Network (VNet), NSGs, Public/Private IPs**
- 💻 **Azure Virtual Machines (Linux and Windows)**
- 🔐 **Azure Firewall and Security Center**
- 📈 **Azure Monitor & Network Watcher**
- 🧠 **Cisco Packet Tracer (for simulation)**
- 🧪 **Wireshark** (for packet inspection and analysis)

## 📂 Key Projects

### 1. ☁️ **Cloud-Based Network Infrastructure with Azure**
Designed and deployed a secure and scalable network using Azure Virtual Networks. Configured routing, subnets, and firewalls to simulate enterprise-grade infrastructure.

### 2. 🔐 **Azure Firewall & NSG Configuration**
Implemented security rules and tested network isolation using Network Security Groups and custom routing.

### 3. 🖥️ **Virtual Machine Provisioning & Monitoring**
Set up multiple Linux and Windows VMs on Azure, enabled RDP/SSH, and monitored performance using Azure Metrics and Logs.
